### Summary:
- This assignment demonstrates the usage of making an express website using view engine, fetch() for gallery, and customdules.

### Additional Comments:
- I initially found it difficult to figure out how to piece everything together as there were a lot of codes in the package, but once I did it made a lot more sense and felt very rewarding. 
- I also appreciate how Tony gave us a visual structure of how the folders should be which helped clear some grey areas.
